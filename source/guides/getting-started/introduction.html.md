# Introduction

BigTest is a framework that aims to make it easy and fast to
acceptance test _all_ single page apps (SPAs) regardless of framework
or library.

When we build applications on the web, we want to be able to test them
as close to where our users will be. A real person using your app is
going to use a real browser; do your tests test your app in a real
browser? And not everybody uses the same browser; do your tests test
your app across multiple, different browsers and devices? What about
the network? Chances are your app talks to the network, and your tests
should account for this too, right? Not to mention a person isn‚Äôt
going to interact with your app on a component level. They‚Äôre
consuming the entire app, using all of it together. All of your
components working with each other to create an experience.

If your tests don‚Äôt test the app in the same way a person would use
it, how confident can you really be in them?

If you prefer video format, Robert DeLuca gave a talk at Byteconf
introducing BigTest:

## Why BigTest?

We had a few requirements when setting out to find a testing tool
that would be ideal for SPAs:

- Fast üèé
- Built with components in mind
- Cross-browser (Firefox, IE, Safari, etc)
- Cross-device (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, etc)
- Cross framework (React, Vue, Ember, Angular, etc)
- Cross test framework (Mocha, Jasmine, etc)

There are tools like [Jest](https://jestjs.io), but those tests don‚Äôt
run in a real browser. There‚Äôs also [Cypress](https://cypress.io), but
as of this writing, you currently can‚Äôt use it outside of Chrome
([others coming soon via
webdriver](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/310)) and
wasn't written with components in mind.

Most of the existing frameworks check a few of those boxes (or
partially check them), but not all of them. With mobile browsing being
so prevalent in today's world we needed something that could easily run
tests on any device we had on hand (by visiting a URL). So, we decided
to build what we wanted to see in the ecosystem!


## Testing philosophy

When writing tests with BigTest it's important to write tests like a
user will be using your app. When a person is interacting with your
app, they‚Äôre using their mouse and keyboard which is translating to
browser events that your app responds to. They‚Äôre clicking things and
expecting to achieve results. This is what our app‚Äôs tests should do
too: send browser events and assert that there was feedback.

If you have tests where you reach into a components or
controllers state, that's not a proper BigTest. All interactions
should come from userland. Another thing to keep an eye for is to make
sure you're asserting against a state in the application the users
_sees_ or interacts with. The goal is to make an interaction and
observe the proper change on the page has happened as a result of that
interaction.

## How does BigTest work?

BigTest mounts and renders your application into the browser. Then the
tests you have written will be executed. Interactor drives
the application around, which is right there inside of the
browser with the tests and rendered application. This is the key
difference between BigTest and other testing frameworks, BigTest
doesn't have a separate process that controls the browser. Which is
why you can just visit a URL and your BigTests will run.

At a high-level BigTest:

- Starts your applications server (which bundles the tests & app)
- Launches the browser(s)
- Starts running the test runner
- Interactor drives the application around (click this, visit a
  route, etc)
- Results are reported back to the CLI


## Packages that makeup BigTest

The BigTest framework is comprised of a few small packages that can
also be used individually. It's helpful to know of these packages
and what their role is in the BigTest framework.

### Convergence

[Convergences](/docs/convergence/) are powerful, immutable, reusable,
and composable assertions that allow you to know immediately when
the desired state is achieved. Put in simple terms: it checks the DOM
every 10ms (for 2s by default) to see if the state you're checking for
is there.

Convergence is the underpinning of everything in BigTest. It's what
makes interactors reliable. Convergence is even used in the CLI for
waiting on browser connected state.

### Interactor

In biology, an [interactor](/docs/interactor/) is defined as part of
an organism that natural selection acts upon. A BigTest interactor
defines part of an app that tests act upon. You can think of
interactors as composable page objects for modern components.

Interactors are the heart and soul of BigTest. In simple terms,
we render the application into the browser and interactors _drive_ the
application around. They use convergences to make sure the element
exists and can be interacted with before performing the interaction you
want.

Interactors also match the composability you get with modern
components. This means you can compose your tests in a similar way you
compose your UI.

To learn more about interactors be sure to look at the [interactor
guides.](/guides/interactors/introduction)

### CLI

The [BigTest CLI](https://github.com/bigtestjs/cli) aims to make
setting up acceptance testing in SPAs easy (like setup, build
tool integration, and browser launching)

You can think of the CLI as a [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html) or
[Testem](https://github.com/testem/testem) but easier to set up and
contains other helpful CLI commands to work with the BigTest framework
(like `bigtest init`).

**Without using the CLI**

Interactors and convergences can be used without BigTest CLI. The
tradeoff is you will need to bring your own browser launcher
(like [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html) or
[Testem](https://github.com/testem/testem)). If your application is
already running tests in the browser with Karma/testem, you can easily plug
convergence/interactor into your existing setup.

going with BigTest.

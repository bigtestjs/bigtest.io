# :warning: DEPRECATED :warning:
In order to make BigTest development faster and friction free, we've consolidated all of our individual projects into a [single repository on the Frontside Organization](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest). We'd love to see you there!

## https://bigtestjs.io
This is the source code for the all new BigTest website

### Prerequisites

1. Ruby
2. Bundler
3. Node

### Installation

1. `bundle install`
2. `yarn install`

### Run Locally

Use `middleman` to fire up a local server at `http://localhost:4567`

### Deploying

The website is deployed to Heroku once CI passes on master. To 
implement your changes, open an pull request. Once merged with
`master`, your changes will be visible in a few minutes.
